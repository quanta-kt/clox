# Peach: A dynamically typed interpreted programming language

I wrote this while reading the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
to follow along with the implementation described in the book.

While this repository closely resembles the original implementation of lox
demonstrated in the book, it does not attempt to be a 1:1 copy.
Instead, the concepts have been adopted to fit into my own code-style.

The commits appear in the same order as the book introduces concepts and code,
including the post-chapter challenges.
