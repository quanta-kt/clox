# CLox: Lox VM written in C
The sole purpose of this repository is to keep track of my
progress reading the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

The commits will appear in the same order as the book introduces the code,
including the post-chapter challenges.

The repository will be archived after I am done reading the book.
